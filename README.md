# Matey:  Numerical Linear Algebra from Scratch

Curious about how libraries like `numpy` work internally, I decided to make my own.  Matey will be a Python package that supports basic matrix operations, least squares, matrix factorization, eigenvalue computations, and more.  The core logic will be written in C for speed and efficiency.  There are several popular methods for writing Python wrappers around C code, and it is currently unclear to me which is better.  Until I decide, I will be writing all algorithms in each of [Python C extensions](https://docs.python.org/3.5/extending/extending.html), [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html), [Cython](http://cython.org/), and pure Python.
